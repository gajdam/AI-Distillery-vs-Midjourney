# AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney
Below I will compare AI tools for generating images. I wanted to see how they handle generating images that could be used as posters, wallpaper or be printed on t-shirts

At the outset, I would like to point out that I used the free version of Distilery and basic plan Midjourney

1. Disitilery - has a trial version - 10 free prompts once a day, has a fairly small community, and the developers are very helpful. Prompts are quite easy to create and improve. However, to get a decent result, you need to spend some time and patience.

2. Midjourney - trial version is not very good. For the cheapest plan you have to pay $10 + vat. Prompts are simply, like in Chat GPT, you can write prompts exacly like in Chat GPT. Of course, it works differently, good as we want to generate something well recognized or easy, but if you care about something more complex then you need to add base images and reach for documentation for various commands to improve our prompt. But in general, all we need is creativity, a minimal knowledge of English, and the ability to link images in a prompt.

## Generated Pics
1. I'm interested in the history of World War 2, so I immediately came up with the idea of making a pictures related to it:
  - Distillery
    - prompt: WW2 US army paratropper standing in front of forest, overhead in the background more paratroopers being droped on theirs parachutes --ar 16:9 --lora realism

      At first look its good, a few tweaks and it will be much better

  - Midjourney
    - prompt: WW2 US army paratropper standing in front of forest, overhead in the background more paratroopers being droped on theirs parachutes
