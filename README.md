# AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney
Below I will compare AI tools for generating images. I wanted to see how they handle generating images that could be used as posters, wallpaper or be printed on t-shirts

At the outset, I would like to point out that I used the free version of Distilery and basic plan Midjourney

1. Disitilery - has a trial version - 10 free prompts once a day, has a fairly small community, and the developers are very helpful. Prompts are quite easy to create and improve. However, to get a decent result, you need to spend some time and patience.

2. Midjourney - trial version is not very good. For the cheapest plan you have to pay $10 + vat. Prompts are simply, like in Chat GPT, you can write prompts exacly like in Chat GPT. Of course, it works differently, good as we want to generate something well recognized or easy, but if you care about something more complex then you need to add base images and reach for documentation for various commands to improve our prompt. But in general, all we need is creativity, a minimal knowledge of English, and the ability to link images in a prompt.

## Generated Pics
1. I'm interested in the history of World War 2, so I immediately came up with the idea of making a pictures related to it:
  - Distillery
    - prompt: WW2 US army paratropper standing in front of forest, overhead in the background more paratroopers being droped on theirs parachutes --ar 16:9 --lora realism
      ![distillery_3c9b34bc-a112-4797-bfbf-99b9bd3a9e8e](https://github.com/gajdam/AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney/assets/116645010/456886b3-36b7-46a2-af3d-b4f42354c358)
      At first look its good, a few tweaks and it will be much better

  - Midjourney
    - prompt: WW2 US army paratropper standing in front of forest, overhead in the background more paratroopers being droped on theirs parachutes

      Midjourney handles better and it easier to edit or change the image - here a version with the style of Salvador Dali:

    ### Conclusion
    Both models cope with historical figures, but the second solution better applies detalis.

2. I decided that I would check how the AI would handle the reproduction of the climate, but without describing it directly. I came up with the plot and added "on the U.S - Mexico border"
   - Distillery
     - prompt: iron man on duty at us-mexico border, truck drivers are shooting to him, dynamic hyper realistic --ar 16:9
       ![ironman mexico border](https://github.com/gajdam/AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney/assets/116645010/fe46069c-b5a1-4144-a98b-a9108e290987)

       And after making the changes suggested by the moderator:
     - prompt: iron man on duty at us-mexico border, truck drivers are shooting to him, dynamic hyper realistic --ar 16:9 --lora realism scifi atmosphere
       ![iron man better](https://github.com/gajdam/AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney/assets/116645010/1561ccd3-8839-431a-b5bc-9ffe67f7436f)

    - Midjourney
      - prompt: Iron man on duty at the U.S - Mexico border
      ![kolega132123_iron_man_on_duty_on_the_U S_-_Mexico_border_--v__899420e9-dfb8-4e00-a9e0-bd78d5c19c63_0](https://github.com/gajdam/AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney/assets/116645010/f7db15ad-817d-4efe-9b76-e0f58bd8d783)

    ### Conclusion
    Both AIs have chosen a good view for the prompt, but as we can see, the detalis (even such related to a rather controversial topics are on the side of the Midjourney model). But I have to admit, it's      great how the Distillery moderation team reacts and offer their experience.

3. And now my favourite - ideal for t-shirt printing
   - Distillery
     - prompt:  lord vader drinking beer while standing on statue of liberty and looking to manhattan --seed 123 --cfg 10 --ar 3:2
       ![vader holding beer 2](https://github.com/gajdam/AI-Distillery-vs-Midjourney/assets/116645010/0b780327-ad51-4a16-8e0d-9d3c2fa4fc06)

   - Midjounrney
